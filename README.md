# Informations
This is a Website on the Mont Saint Michel. It's very simple and there no really incredible informations but all the work is on the transitions. It's just texts and a few informations with pictures so enjoy it !

Unfortunately, I was a beginner so the web site is not responsive and i was working on a very large screen, so sorry for those who have a little screen. My future projects will be better, I promise.

There is a little quizz at the end so read everything carefully !

## Language
Program with HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript.
